### 📄 **Project Summary**

This is my personal portfolio website designed to represent my professional identity, showcase my skills, and highlight the projects I've worked on. It serves as a central hub where potential clients, employers, and collaborators can learn more about me and reach out directly through an integrated contact form.

The portfolio is built using the following technologies:

---

### 🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout, creating a responsive design, and enhancing visual aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity such as smooth scrolling and responsive navigation.
- **PHP**: Used to handle form submissions securely, sending contact form data directly to my email.
- *(Optional additions)*  
  - **Bootstrap **: For faster, mobile-first design development (if used).
  - **Font Awesome / Google Fonts**: For clean icons and custom typography.
